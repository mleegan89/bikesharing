Image 1 - Using the busiest month of the year we can see that the busiest time of the day is post workday before 7:00 p.m. We also saw a spike in pre workday rides before 8:00 a.m. This info might not only help us with knowing when is the best times to conduct maintenance but also when the business should reposition bikes.

Image 7 - As you might expect based on previous data representations, most subcribers are male and highest usage falls between Mon - Fri. 

## Summary 
In order to complete this analysis it may be neccessary to look at one additonal city with similar characteristics to Des Moines. It would also be neccessary to look at this analysis with post-covid data as many people are no longer commuting to work.
